    Indian National Flag - Tiranga ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
The Indian National Flag, also known as the Tiranga (Tricolor), is a symbol of India's freedom, unity, and pride. It was adopted on July 22, 1947, just before India gained independence from British rule.

Design & Meaning
The flag consists of three horizontal stripes of different colors, each with a significant meaning:

ðŸŸ  Saffron (Top Strip) â€“ Represents courage, sacrifice, and strength of the nation.
âšª White (Middle Strip) â€“ Symbolizes truth, peace, and purity.
ðŸŸ¢ Green (Bottom Strip) â€“ Represents prosperity, growth, and fertility.

At the center is the Ashoka Chakra, a 24-spoke navy blue wheel, taken from the Lion Capital of Ashoka. It represents dharma (righteousness), progress, and motion.

Flag Code of India
The flag must be hoisted with respect and never touch the ground.
It should always be displayed upright with saffron at the top.
Citizens were once restricted from using the flag for personal display, but now it can be used with dignity and respect.
